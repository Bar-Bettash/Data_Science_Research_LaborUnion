# Labor Unions and Product Recalls

In a recent study by Kini, et. al. (2023), the impact of labor unions on product quality failures is explored. The research finds that unionization has a negative effect on the cumulative number of product recalls occurring 3 years after unionization. 

Several federal agencies possess the authority to mandate product recalls due to concerns over consumer safety. These recalls typically focus on food, drugs, medical devices, vehicles, and various consumer products such as children’s items, household appliances, heating and cooling equipment, home furnishings, hardware, tools, and yard equipment, among others.

### Dataset Details
You have access to union election data conducted at 382 firms over a 10-year period, as compiled by Kini, et. al. (2023). The dataset, available in the `union.data` file in *.Rdta format on moodle, includes the following variables:
- **firm_ID**: Unique identifier of the firm.
- **year**: Year in which the union election took place (2003 – 2013).
- **pct_vote_union**: Percentage of workers voting in favor of unionization.
- **union_won**: Binary indicator (1/0) where 1 indicates union won (vote percentage > 50%).
- **RTW_state**: Indicator for "right to work" state, where workers can opt not to join the union.
- **industry_ID**: Identifier indicating the industry sector of the firm.
- **has_recall_1yr**: Binary indicator (1/0) for product recall in the last year.
- **has_recall_2yr**: Binary indicator (1/0) for product recall in the last 2 years.
- **has_recall_3yr**: Binary indicator (1/0) for product recall in the last 3 years.

### Research Question
The primary research question addressed in this study is: 
### What is the effect of unionization on product recalls? 
This involves examining how the formation of labor unions influences the occurrence of product recalls over time.
